      <span class="text-sm text-gray-700">Welcome back to another maths talks! For the next iteration of this series we will be hearing from Matt and James regarding statistics and geometry.

<p>Please Not First Past The Post: An Introduction To Voting Theory with Matthew Low</p>
<p>Democracy can be a complicated thing sometimes. Elections are one of the most important applications of mathematics and statistics in modern society. However, a good electoral system needs to satisfy a range of criteria, which can make it difficult to formulate a method that is both effective and not overly complicated. The theory of voting, which falls under the interdisciplinary area of social choice theory, combines methods from mathematics, economics and political science. Many people assume the best answer to “who should win an election” is the person who “gets the most votes”, but this idea is fundamentally flawed, and in this talk we will discuss why through the lens of voting theory. We’ll also explore some simple and complicated voting systems used throughout the world.</p>

<p>Weyl's law: When analysis informs geometry with James Stanfield</p>
<p>A famous question originally asked by Kac in 1966 goes as follows: Can one hear the shape of a drum? That is, are the frequencies of sound made by a drum (it's spectrum) uniquely determined by its geometry? In this talk, we will expand on exactly what this means, and investigate Weyl's law: a beautiful theorem relating the asymptotic behaviour of a drum's spectrum to its area.</span>
